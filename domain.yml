# Alright, so slots -> since near all of them are from intent (bar the addresses, which will be from text)
# I don't think I need to create entities for them. Just keeping them as slots is fine, esp because none of them would influence conversation
# (well, bar the yes/no from whether you would like to continue, but that's more of a story I believe)
